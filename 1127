<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup
language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and
render them into multimedia web pages.
HTML describes the structure of a web
page semantically and originally included
cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
<img src = "coding.jpg" width="100%">
// imge 뒷부분을 속성이라고 함. 속성의 위치들은 상관없음
// 태그의 이름만으로는 정보가 부족할 때 속성 활용 

<p style="margin-top:60px">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
With HTML constructs, images and other objects,
such as interactive forms, may be embedded into
the rendered page. It provides a means to create
structured documents by denoting structural semantics
for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated
by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
